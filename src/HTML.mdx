# HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Play around with your own `index.html` file and just learn the basics of HTML and CSS. Editing the Wiki will be a lot easier to understand once you grasp the basics. Below, I link a book from the INFO 343 class at the University of Washington, the class that teaches client side development in depth. I recommend that book for learning every part of the basics.

Once you understand most of the basics (chapters 1-12), then you'll be ready to take on the Wiki. You don't have to install the programs mentioned in Getting Setup, but I highly recommend using something you're comfortable with, and something that can help you find errors easily. Reading up to chapter 12 is roughly 3 weeks of content in the class, but it's a smooth read if you're very interested in learning how to do something and have an end goal of making the Wiki polished and beautiful.

## HTML Fundamentals

HTML Fundamentals chapter can be found here: https://info343.github.io/html-fundamentals.html

You do not have to worry about the "Web Page Template" part. Later on when we start editing the Wiki pages, you'll find you only need a single opening and closing tag.

## CSS Fundamentals 

Read Chapters 5, 6, and 7 here: https://info343.github.io/css.html. You might want to also look at making your website 'Responsive' by reading Chapter 8. 

A lot of teams have used a CSS Framework like Bootstrap, which you can read about using in chapter 9.

## JavaScript Fundamentals

The book goes into the entire basics of JavaScript as a language. JavaScript is a very powerful language, that can do more than just modify websites. However, we are using JavaScript in the context of editing websites, so you'll need to learn the fundamentals of that. When you read, you'll want to definitely read **chapter 12.2**. This teaches you about DOM manipulation, which is what you would do on your iGEM page.
