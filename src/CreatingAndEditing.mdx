# Getting Started with MediaWiki

iGEM uses a system called MediaWiki. It was a software wiki package originally intended to be used on Wikipedia. It is now in use by a lot of other projects in the Wikimedia Foundation and other wikis. 

Before we can make a wiki, we have to know how to do basic edits to a page. You’d be surprised at how many things require special attention to modify on the wiki.

If you’ve ever made your own website before, you may have had to just upload all the relevant files and immediately have a website that you could use. iGEM’s uses **MediaWiki**, which **requires** you to type in the HTML for every individual page. Controversially, a lot of web programmers dislike this model, because it increases complexity if they want to do complex stuff. However, note that using MediaWiki is a godsend for some teams that don’t have any knowledge of web programming. That is why there will likely be _no change_ to this structure for years to come.

For demonstrations, all pages will be a blank page from [Team:Washington’s iGEM Wiki](http://2018.igem.org/Team:Washington). We will also be using Google Chrome as a web browser.

## Wiki page structure

The iGEM wiki is structured in a very straightforward manner.

`http://[YEAR].igem.org/Team:[TEAM]` will lead you to the main page of the specified team. Take note that there is **NO BACKSLASH** after `[Team]`. If you have a backslash, it will go to a blank uncreated page. Be **very** careful when modifying your pages that you don't put everything on the page with a backslash after it, or nobody will be able to find your page!

There are many special pages that the judges take into consideration for determining what medal you will receive at the Jamboree. These pages can be found [here](http://2018.igem.org/Judging/Pages_for_Awards). Read through it. Some pages aren't tied to awards, some are required for evaluation, and some are tied to special awards. One of these pages can be the `Attributions` page for your team, which follows the link structure `http://[YEAR].igem.org/Team:[TEAM]/Attributions`. 

## Editing existing pages

All the special pages noted in the last section will be an existing page for you to work on. Those special pages are outlined in the iGEM page I linked. It's a large page that goes through everything you need to know, but I will paraphrase the important parts. 

The judged page we will be looking at is the Human Practices page. You can see that when you go to it, there will be a box at the top to signify that the judges will be looking at the page. You have to delete this box.

For all pages, you simply have to follow these steps to modify the page:
1. Be logged in and make sure you are in your team registry (otherwise you won't be allowed to edit the pages)
2. Go to the top bar and find `wiki tools`
3. Hover over that and go to `edit page`
4. Modify the page as you like (Read below for more tips)
5. Click `save` and the page will be updated

Note how there is a blue bordered **ALERT** box on this page. If you want to be evalluated for this award, it is **imperitive** that you remove (before a certain judging date) the `div` that houses this alert message. The code you have to remove looks like this:

```
<div class="column full_size judges-will-not-evaluate">
<h3>★ ALERT! </h3>
<p>This page is used by the judges to evaluate your team for the <a href="http://2018.igem.org/Judging/Medals">medal criterion</a> or <a href="http://2018.igem.org/Judging/Awards"> award listed above</a>. </p> <p> Delete this box in order to be evaluated for this medal criterion and/or award. See more information at <a href="http://2018.igem.org/Judging/Pages_for_Awards"> Instructions for Pages for awards</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="clear">&#60/div>
```

The way this works is that the system will scan through your pages and most likely find the div with the class `judges-will-not-evaluate` and if it exists, it will not evaluate the page.
