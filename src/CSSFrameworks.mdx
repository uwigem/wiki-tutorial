# CSS Frameworks

If you would like to learn more about CSS Frameworks, please read Chapter 9 of the INFO 343 book here: https://info343.github.io/css-frameworks.html

Note, you do **not** have to use a CSS framework. However, they make designing something a lot easier. Frameworks like Bootstrap allow you to only worry about the color and design of the content while providing you a bunch of pieces that you can mix and match. For example a navigation bar is one of the things that Bootstrap lets you have very easily, and it's heavily customizable.

## Installing a CSS Framework

You'll notice that in the book, a link to a CDN is used to import the library for Bootstrap is used. 

Although a lot of teams don't really follow this rule anyways, using a CDN is actually not allowed. iGEM doesn't actually seem to check or double down on this. However, because you are now aware of that rule, you should follow it!

How do you install a library like this without using the CDN? Easy! In this example, I'll be taking Bootstrap's CDN links from their [getting started](http://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/getting-started/download/) pages.

Their links and scripts to copy paste are here:

```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.1.3/css/bootstrap.min.css" integrity="sha384-MCw98/SFnGE8fJT3GXwEOngsV7Zt27NXFoaoApmYm81iuXoPkFOJwJ8ERdknLPMO" crossorigin="anonymous">
<script src="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.1.3/js/bootstrap.min.js" integrity="sha384-ChfqqxuZUCnJSK3+MXmPNIyE6ZbWh2IMqE241rYiqJxyMiZ6OW/JmZQ5stwEULTy" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.3.1.slim.min.js" integrity="sha384-q8i/X+965DzO0rT7abK41JStQIAqVgRVzpbzo5smXKp4YfRvH+8abtTE1Pi6jizo" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/popper.js/1.14.3/umd/popper.min.js" integrity="sha384-ZMP7rVo3mIykV+2+9J3UJ46jBk0WLaUAdn689aCwoqbBJiSnjAK/l8WvCWPIPm49" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
```

Now, just take the links from those, don't worry about the integrity or crossorigin. Those are to double check that the script is reliable.

```
https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.1.3/css/bootstrap.min.css
https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.1.3/js/bootstrap.min.js
https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.3.1.slim.min.js
https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/popper.js/1.14.3/umd/popper.min.js
```
If you follow these links, you'll see a mess of code that is what is known as minified. They have as much white space taken out as possible so that the file size becomes a lot smaller. A lot of code bundlers usually do this so users download things faster.

You can copy paste each mess one at a time into your own template page, and then call  that template using the method I outlined from earlier: 

```
<link href="http://2018.igem.org/Template:Washington/BootstrapMinCSS?action=raw&ctype=text/css" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" />
```

You can do this with the JavaScript too! Just note that this new jQuery might interfere with the existing jQuery on the page that iGEM has installed on their site by default. I don't think it'll cause any major headaches, though. 

After installing everything, you can use the Bootstrap classes and functions immediately. Look at the documentation and try to find some examples online if you get stuck.
