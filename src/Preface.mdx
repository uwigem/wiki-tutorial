# A guide to writing an iGEM Wiki

Writing an iGEM wiki will be undoubtable one of the **most frustrating** things every team has to face. Some teams have members that have never touched an ounce of HTML, while some have members dedicated towards writing a wiki. Regardless of where you are on that spectrum, there are many obstacles that will be faced. Navigating the iGEM MediaWiki system itself is complicated to learn. 

Hopefully this book and the later accompanying video tutorials will give you lots of knowledge of how to edit the wiki. Things have changed from 2017 to 2018, and it may change in the future. For the next few years, as long as I am a part of iGEM, I will be releasing updated versions of these tutorials. 

This book **does not** assume a lot of HTML, CSS, or JavaScript knowledge. However, this book also does not go into everything you need to know in terms of programming. I will link additional reading sources later on on the specific topics for introducing HTML. They are easy reads in my opinion.

Let's begin.
